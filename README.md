# Hi, I'm Raymond 👋

I'm a Computer Science freshman learning **Python** and building small projects every week.

## What I’m learning right now
- Python basics (functions, loops, lists, dictionaries)
- Git + GitHub (commits, branches, pull requests)
- Problem solving (DSA fundamentals)

## Projects
- 🔹 [Project 1] – coming soon
- 🔹 [Project 2] – coming soon

## Goals for this semester
- Build 4–6 beginner projects with clean READMEs
- Get comfortable with data structures + algorithms basics
- Create a portfolio that proves steady progress

## How I work
I keep my repos organized, write simple READMEs, and improve my code over time.
